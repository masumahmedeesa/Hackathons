# I have participated in two Hackathon until March 2020
## In IUT Hackathon
- Problem was Health Related. We had challenges to make appoinment system really very easier using Android Application. We hardly made 'Android App' for this project. We just made prototype, SRS, presentation and also some writing solution. 'Bangla Language' was our first choice. We used 'ADOBE XD' for making prototype.

## In SUST Hackathon
- We tried to solve Banking/Insurance Loan taking system on online by making 'Android Application, Inlo' which would be affliated by Bangladesh Goverment. We used php raw code to connect Android app with MySQL phpmyadmin. It was one of the biggest mistakes of ours to choose phpmyadmin instead of using Firebase. That's why, we were far beyond from the Desired Application. Simple presentation of Android Application is provided with Code.
